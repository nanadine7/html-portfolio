<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Nadine (Actually, that's not my real name). </p>

<p>I'm from Thailand, the land of smile and the suck goverment. My country is really cool and pretty except the goverment.
  People are very nice and kind except me. When I told my new friends 'Hi, I'm from Thailand'. It's mean I'm from Thailand not Taiwan.
  and also I'm not Chinese even though my mom is half-Chinese, haft-Thai, and more. Trust me, my face don't close like Chinese.
  but anyway, I don't mind if you call Thailand is Taiwan or think I'm Chinese.</p>

<p>I started learn coding because I don't want to work with human. but I know I can't avoid human because I'm a human!</p>
